It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n   * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a `scheduler`.\n   *\n   * ## Example\n   * ### Subscribe with an Observer\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const sumObserver = {\n   *   sum: 0,\n   *   next(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   error() {\n   *     // We actually could just remove this method,\n   *     // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n   *   },\n   *   complete() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n   *   }\n   * };\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n   *   .subscribe(sumObserver);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Subscribe with functions\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs'\n   *\n   * let sum = 0;\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3).subscribe(\n   *   value => {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     sum = sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum)\n   * );\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Cancel a subscription\n   * ```ts\n   * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const subscription = interval(1000).subscribe(\n   *   num => console.log(num),\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => {\n   *     // Will not be called, even when cancelling subscription.\n   *     console.log('completed!');\n   *   }\n   * );\n   *\n   * setTimeout(() => {\n   *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n   *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n   * }, 2500);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // 0 after 1s\n   * // 1 after 2s\n   * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n   *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n   *  Observable.\n   * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.
